**WARNING:** These versions were under Beta. There may be some bugs and compatibility issues.

# 1.0.0-BETA2

- Added warning on startup if PHAR Converter cloned from `dev` branch
- Now throws error when trying to convert internal directories (`bin`, `src`, `temp`) to PHAR
- Now PHAR Converter won't terminate after throwing an error
- Changed directory and PHAR file not found error message

# 1.0.0-BETA3

- Added direct converting mode (See [**Converting Directly**](https://github.com/KygekTeam/PHAR-Converter/tree/main#converting-directly) for more details)
- Now `config.yml` file is checked and parsed before specifying convert mode
- Added PHPDoc in `CLI.php`

## Known Issues

- PHAR Converter will not run properly if arguments not following the `--{ARG}="{VALUE}"` format (probably should use RegEx to fix it)
